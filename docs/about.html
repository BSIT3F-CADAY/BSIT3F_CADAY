        </p>
        <p id="abtpara">
            Hello! My name is Stephen Caday, and I am a passionate game developer with several years of experience in creating engaging and innovative games. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from mobile games to complex desktop and console titles. My expertise spans multiple game development tools and engines, including Unity, Unreal Engine, and various scripting languages such as C# and C++. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I am skilled in game mechanics, AI design, and performance optimization. I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to push the boundaries of what's possible in gaming, and I take pride in delivering high-quality, user-focused experiences. Through my journey, I have not only honed my technical skills but also developed a deep understanding of what it takes to build immersive worlds and compelling gameplay that players can enjoy.
